Welcome to my Digital Garden for joshg!

I use GrapheneOS and other Linux based systems on a regular. I don't have any time for cryptocurrencies anymore the only one I really have any belief in is XMR (Monero).

I previously used QubesOS for a few years to keep myself safe online. I also have done some Twitch live streams in the past doing video games streams.

Thanks for stopping by!
joshg.
